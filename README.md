# WebDingsCalculator
WebDings Calculator made for AP CS Principles @ Hisar School 2023-2024


This project is a simple 4-operation calculator with a font called "WebDings." I used this font to give it a more creative look and give it some personality.

This project was made in Playgrounds using SwiftUI. 

I followed these steps in making this project:
  - Create all the buttons required for this calculator and place them accordingly
  - Use a disabled button for the LCD with the alignment Trailing.
  - Create required variables:
    - A String called `DispText`
      - This is what is displayed on the LCD
    - An Int Called `InPocket`
     - This is the stored variable in the calculator when an operation is made
    - An Int Called `Sign`
      - This states the type of  operation
        - 0: Empty, 1: Addition, 2: Subtraction, 3: Multiplication, 4: Division
    - A bool Called `AskaLnglSryu`
      - This boolean tells the code if it is in repeated calculation mode
    - A String called `ShnjIkri`
      - This is the variable that sets the font for the calculator.
